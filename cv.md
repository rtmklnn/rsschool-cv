# Summary

I'am an ex-T&D manager on my way of restarting my career and becoming a self-taught WEB developer with a great help of RS.school. Having more then 10 years of relevant professional experience in the field of professional education and development I have realised that I don't have any ambitious goals to achieve so here I am now learning to code. Hope to be your trainee soon so let's be in touch.
